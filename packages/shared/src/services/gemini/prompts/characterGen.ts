Analyze this character image and extract a PRECISE character specification for consistent reproduction.
The character concept is: ${concept}

This spec will be used to maintain IDENTICAL character appearance across 45 stickers. Be extremely specific.

Extract:
1. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: Body shape (round/slim/square), proportions (head-to-body ratio like 1:1 or 2:1), limb style (stubby/long/noodle), overall silhouette shape.
2. FACIAL FEATURES (CRITICAL FOR CONSISTENCY):
   - Eye shape (round/oval/dot/almond), eye size (large/medium/small relative to face), eye color, pupil style (dot/highlight/star), eye spacing
   - Nose shape (button/triangle/dot/absent)
   - Mouth style (simple curve/cat-mouth/W-shape/dot), default mouth size
   - Eyebrow style (thin/thick/absent/dot)
   - Ear shape and position (if applicable)
   - Cheek marks (blush circles/lines/none), their color
   - Any facial accessories (glasses, freckles, whiskers, etc.)
3. COLOR PALETTE: List EVERY color used with location (e.g., "#FFB6C1 pink - body, #FFFFFF white - belly, #FF69B4 hot pink - cheeks, #000000 black - outlines and eyes")
4. DISTINGUISHING FEATURES: Unique elements that define this character and MUST appear in every sticker (e.g., "red bow on left ear, striped tail, star-shaped belly mark")
5. ART STYLE: Line thickness (thin 1px/medium 2-3px/thick 4px+), outline color, shading style (flat/cel-shaded/gradient), detail level (minimal/moderate/detailed)

Be EXTREMELY specific about facial features - they are the #1 source of inconsistency.

Generate 45 unique emoji ideas optimized for LINE messenger emoji sales.

CHARACTER REFERENCE (use this to write accurate imagePrompt descriptions):
- Appearance: ${characterSpec.physicalDescription}
- Colors: ${characterSpec.colorPalette}
- Key Features: ${characterSpec.distinguishingFeatures}
- Art Style: ${characterSpec.artStyle}

${culturalContext}

${languageSpecificCategories}

Focus on expressions and scenarios that drive the highest engagement and purchases on LINE messenger.
Think about what makes users want to BUY and USE these stickers in daily conversations.

Categories to distribute (45 total):
1. Basic Emotions (10) - Universal emotions that get used most frequently
2. Greetings & Responses (8) - Gestures for hi, bye, thanks, sorry, OK, NO
3. Daily Actions (8) - Eating, coffee, work, study, gaming, music
4. Emphasis Reactions (8) - Amazing, thumbs up, fighting, congrats, shy, rage
5. Trending/Humor (6) - Money, lucky, healing, flex, TMI, lazy
6. Special Occasions (5) - Birthday, new year, christmas, rainy day, cold

STRATEGY DIRECTION (each imagePrompt MUST reflect this):
- Sales Strategy: ${strategyContext.salesReasoning}
- Cultural Optimization: ${strategyContext.culturalNotes}

Each imagePrompt must be a SINGLE SENTENCE that:
1. Describes the character (referencing the CHARACTER REFERENCE above) doing a specific action/expression
2. Incorporates the strategy direction naturally (e.g., cultural appeal, sales-driving elements)
3. Is vivid enough to guide image generation but not overly detailed

CRITICAL RULES:
- DO NOT include any text on the emoji. Image only.
- Distinct silhouettes for each emote.
- Exaggerated expressions for visibility at small sizes.
- Prioritize emoji that users will send MOST OFTEN in LINE conversations.
- For EACH emote, write an "imagePrompt": a SINGLE SENTENCE that captures both the emoji scene AND the strategy direction.

CHARACTER IDENTITY (MUST MAINTAIN EXACTLY):
- Appearance: ${characterSpec.physicalDescription}

- Art Style: ${characterSpec.artStyle}

FACIAL FEATURES LOCK (CRITICAL - DO NOT DEVIATE):
${characterSpec.facialFeatures}
The face structure, eye shape, nose, mouth, and all facial details MUST be IDENTICAL to the reference image. Only the EXPRESSION changes (e.g., smile vs frown), never the underlying facial structure.

STICKER SCENE: ${idea.imagePrompt}
ABSOLUTELY NO TEXT. PURE IMAGE ONLY.

RULES:
1. The character MUST look identical to the reference image - same colors, proportions, facial features.
2. Only the expression, pose, and action should change - NOT the character design.
3. SOLID WHITE BACKGROUND. Square 1:1. SINGLE CHARACTER ONLY.
4. Design for TINY size: exaggerated expression, minimal background elements, bold lines.
